## Project Objective
Design a space habitat that can sustain human life and meet the needs of astronauts living and working in space.

## Steps
1. Introduction to space habitats: Introduce the topic of space habitats and discuss the challenges of designing a habitat that can sustain human life in space. Discuss key features of space habitats, such as life support systems, radiation shielding, and energy sources.
2. Research: Students conduct research on space habitats, including current and proposed designs. They research the needs of astronauts in space, such as food, water, air, and exercise.
3. Design: Students design a space habitat that can sustain human life for an extended period of time. They consider the necessary components such as sleeping quarters, food storage, exercise areas, etc.
4. Floor Plan: Students create a detailed floor plan of the space habitat. They must consider the placement of each component, the flow of air and water, and other environmental factors.
5. Budget: Students create a budget for the construction of their space habitat. They must consider the cost of materials, construction, and ongoing maintenance.
6. Documentation: Students document their space habitat design. They must explain the design choices they made and how their habitat meets the needs of astronauts.
7. Demonstration or Presentation: Students present their space habitat design in a format of their choosing. This can be done through animation, stop motion, a slide deck, the sky is the limit. They must explain the features of their habitat, how it works, and how it meets the needs of astronauts. They can also display their floor plan and any other visual aids they created.``
8. Optional Extension: Students can use 3D modeling software or other design tools to create a visual representation of their space habitat.

## Assessment
The project can be assessed using a rubric that includes the following criteria:
- Depth and accuracy of research
- Creativity and originality of design
- Realism of floor plan
- Appropriateness of budget
- Clarity and effectiveness of written report
- Quality of demonstration or presentation

Overall, this project integrates multiple subjects and skills such as research, design, budgeting, technical writing, and demonstration or presentation. It also challenges students to think critically and creatively, while also considering the practicalities of real-world engineering projects.
